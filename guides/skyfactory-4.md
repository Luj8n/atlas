### Recommended RAM amount:

- It doesn't use a lot of memory, I could run it with 3GB. I usually play with 6GB. But don't put it over 10GB, it could decrease performance.

### Notes:

- When you join, type `/topography island home` to make your own island and teleport to it.
- To invite someone to your team type `/tofe invite {username}`.
- To invite someone to your island type `/topography island invite {username}`
- You can teleport to someone by doing `/tpa {username}`. They have to accept with `/tpaccept`. Same for `/tpahere {username}`
