This is a website made for (saltAxAtlas)[https://www.twitch.tv/saltaxatlas] and other code streamer communities

It shows the status of the modded minecraft server (later maybe not only minecraft). There is also a section for game/modpack guides.

It is mainly made with:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)

## Getting Started

### First, install missing dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

### Then run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app.

## Guides

- To make a guide just make a new markdown file under the `/guides` folder.

- The name of the file should be just like the title of the guide but all lowercase, and spaces replaced with dashes. Example: "SkyFactory 4" => "skyfactory-4"

- Each guide should have a:

  - Title
  - Logo (a link to a picture)
  - Date (of the guide)

- If you are unsure how to do it, look at other examples under the `/guides` folder.
